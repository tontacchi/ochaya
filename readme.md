# Ochaya (お茶屋) — a hidden teahouse for dotfiles 🍵

**ochaya** is my hidden dotfiles repository —  
a quiet, deliberate space where configuration files are kept in order and harmony.

It serves as a personal teahouse for the tools I rely on daily:  
`bash`, `tmux`, `neovim`, and more.

## 🌿 Purpose

- Maintain consistent configurations across systems
- Keep the home directory uncluttered
- Symlink-based setup for clarity and control
- Peacefully version-controlled with Git
